- Problem Description

Many-a-times, in households the person in charge of kitchen gets confused about deciding the cuisine for the day. Adding on it, they are dry days with ingredients available being a constraint.

A few more constraints to list out are the seasonality of vegetables, condiments, spices and the pattern or preferences of food choices.

Some broader constraints can be the sort of recipes suggested with accord to the time of the meal, apt choices with respect to the prevailing weather conditions.

- Solution

A module which offers two divisions, the first one being: “What can I make?” which offers recipes as solutions to the ingredients available with the user; the second one being: “What do I make?”, where the module suggests recipes with accord to the food preferences drawn from the food pattern fed to the machine.

It resolves the confusion faced by people deciding on their meals for the day based on ingredients or even explore unheard of dishes in Indian cuisines.

Also, it can be deployed by restaurants and food-outs to venture out on new cuisines and deciding on the menu, updating it regularly.
